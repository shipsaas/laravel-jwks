Provide libraries to help you deal with JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) in Laravel üòâ

Documentation: [ShipSaaS Laravel JWKS](https://laravel-jwks.shipsaas.tech)

## Supports
- Laravel 10+
- PHP 8+
- **RSA** algorithm only (for now)

## Sample use cases

Ever thought of microservices? One of the biggest challenges is having the Authentication (& Authorization) service.

However, you don't have to spend enormous time building a brand new AuthService and migrating the current users.

Your current app = the core, the heart of everything. Let's build satellite services around that.

With (Laravel) JWKS, we will have:

- The main app exposes the JWKs internally for the satellite microservices.
- The satellite services can simply obtain the JWKs and verify the signed JWT token before handling the actual requests.

JWKS is supported in multiple languages e.g.: Node.js, Go,...
